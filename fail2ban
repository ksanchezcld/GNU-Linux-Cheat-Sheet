Fail2ban is one of the most popular open source intrusion detection/prevention framework written in python programming language. It operates by scanning log files such as /var/log/secure, /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/pwdfail etc. for too many failed login attempts. Fail2ban used to update Netfilter/iptables or TCP Wrapper’s hosts.deny file, to reject an attacker’s IP address for a set amount of time. It also has a ability to unban a blocked IP address for a certain period of time set by administrators. However, an certain minutes of unban is more enough to stop such malicious attacks.
